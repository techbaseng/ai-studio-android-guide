## What This Is

A comprehensive step-by-step deployment guide that walks developers through the full pipeline:

- Setting up **Google AI Studio** and obtaining a Gemini API key
- Building and configuring the project files (`manifest.json`, service worker, `vercel.json`)
- Bridging through **GitHub** as the source-control and CI hand-off point
- Deploying to **Vercel** via GitHub integration
- Installing the live web app as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** on Android
- Managing updates, debugging common issues, and maintaining the deployment

The guide is a single-file HTML document with an embedded sidebar navigation, interactive code blocks with one-click copy, an accordion troubleshooting section, and a reading progress bar — no build tools or dependencies required.

The visual design mirrors the deployment journey itself: a four-stage pipeline (AI Studio → GitHub → Vercel → Android) runs through the hero and accent colours, on a clean light interface set in **Geist** — Vercel's own typeface, fittingly, since that's where the guide ends up.
